Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. Agriculture is the backbone of every countryâ€™s economy and development. In the current modern society, it is our duty and concern we should consider the importance of agriculture and its improvement as the nature resources are diminishing day to day. Researchers in modern agriculture are using machine learning algorithms at greater scale and helping make more accurate, real-time predictions. Modern agriculture has the potential to discover even more ways to achieve higher productions, conserve water, use nutrients and energy more efficiently, and adapt to climate change.

One major problem faced in agriculture production is the effect of weeds on the plant growth. According to the WEED SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA, on an annual basis, potential loss in value for corn is $27 billion and for soybean is $16 billion based on data from 2007 to 2013. Overall, average % yield loss with no weed control in corn is 52% and soybean is 49.5%. The impact of weeds on the agriculture production is very high in terms of crop yield and quality, which must be controlled at the seedling stage.

Our motivation and interest in challenging this task is the thought, where we can draw a line between plant seedlings and weed seedlings. This approach can make any machinery to easily detect the weed and remove it effectively without disturbing the plants growth leading to increased productivity.
