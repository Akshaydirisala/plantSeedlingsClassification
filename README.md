#Incorporating Machine learning with Artificial intelligence
 Using Neural Networks to do classification of Images of Mango tree Plantations.

Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. Agriculture is the backbone of every country’s economy and development. In the current modern society, it is our duty and concern to give importance to agriculture and its improvement as the nature resources are diminishing day to day. Researchers in modern agriculture are using machine learning algorithms at greater scale and helping make more accurate, real-time predictions. Modern agriculture has the potential to discover even more ways to achieve higher productions, conserve water, use nutrients and energy more efficiently, and adapt to climate change.


It is believed that Buddha himself rested and meditated with his fellow monks in the peaceful lush mango groves.I feel that mango groves are healthy enough to provide him a rich spiritual environment to Buddha,that said as we know Mango is the king of fruits with its rich vitamin resources ,are facing symptoms like fruit and leaf droppings ,top bearing due to moisture and nutrient deficiency respectively.I think buddha may not be able to meditate under the trees with these symptoms peacefully.
Telangana state in India has Mango as its pride state fruit.According to 2017 statistics of telangana it has 95262 hectares of mango farming with a production of 4,58,341 tonnes in 2015–2016 which is being gradually decreasing in the last decade. Precision agriculture incorporated with Deep learning could help mango farmings in increasing their productivity and governments to encourage its people to increase the mango farming.

The major plant diseases in mango are Anthracnose,Powdery mildew ,Phoma blight which are reducing the crop productivity and making losses to the mango farmers.These diseases can be prevented and removed from the mango trees at an early stage using precision farming methodologies. Alphonso.ai is a drone I am working on ,where I am implementing image classification using Convolution neural networks to identify the diseased leafs to branch out immediately and the Alphonso.ai is cable of GPS where it tracks the moisture in the soil and ensures the farmers the land is good with nutrients and moisture levels are maintained for the farm. Alphonso.ai recognizes the diseased leafs and scissors them out of the plant or buy spraying the pesticides at the affected spots.

One major problem faced in agriculture production is the effect of weeds on the plant growth. According to the WEED SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA, on an annual basis, potential loss in value for corn is $27 billion and for soybean is $16 billion based on data from 2007 to 2013. Overall, average % yield loss with no weed control in corn is 52% and soybean is 49.5%. The impact of weeds on the agriculture production is very high in terms of crop yield and quality, which must be controlled at the seedling stage.

Our motivation and interest in challenging this task is the thought, where we can draw a line between plant seedlings and weed seedlings. This approach can make any machinery to easily detect the weed and remove it effectively without disturbing the plants growth leading to increased productivity.

## Problem Statement
Humans while cultivating can easily recognize plant vs weed but it is attached with lot of human work power, so making machines to learn these techniques we can save time and cost. The ability to differentiate weed from plant so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The problem is to create a classifier which can determine a plant species from a photo.

# Datasets and Inputs

Dataset is obtained from:https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification

The dataset comprises 12 plant species :
1)Black-grass                 	7) Loose Silky-bent
2)Charlock			8) Maize
3)Cleavers			9) Scentless Mayweed
4)Common Chickweed		10) Shepherds Purse
5)Common wheat		  	11) Small-flowered Cranesbill
6)Powdery Mildew			12) Cephaleuros virescens causes a leaf spot disease

File descriptions
train.csv - the training set, with plant species organized by folder
test.csv - the test set, you need to predict the species of each image.

# Solution Statement
As we know one of the major applications of Convolutional Neural Networks is image classification. Using CNN approach, we would build a classifier where we will first consider that all images are in fixed size by doing resizing. As the computer interprets every image as 3dimensional array, my design of CNN architecture would be to taking the image array and making it much deeper when it is tall or wide with the use of convolutional layers to make layers deeper and max pooling layers to decrease the spatial dimensions. As there are 12 species my output layer would have 12 nodes. We will use keras to build using relu activation function.  	  

# Benchmark Model
we will develop a CNN classifier which will give high F1 score and try to reduce the type 2 error because if the model predicts a plant as weed machine will remove the plant which is loss.we will build a confusion matrix which will give the differences between the predicted class and true class among the 12 species .

	        Weed	Not weed
Weed	    Correct	Type1
Not weed    Type2	Correct

# Evaluation Metrices
As this project data is considered from the Kaggle, F1 score can be considered as an evaluation metric. we will consider F1 score on my testing dataset. Higher the F1 score better the model

# Project Design
We would load all the 12 plant species images and see how images will be loaded, resize all images into fixed size if they are in different sizes. Next, we will add convolutional and max pooling layers to build CNN with 12 output nodes and check how accurately the model is classifying the plant images using confusion matrix.
Tools: Python,Jupyter notebook,pandas,numpy,keras,tensorflow,seaborn and will add if any libraries that I will use.
